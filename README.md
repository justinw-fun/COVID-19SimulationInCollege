This project simulates the COVID-19 spreading in college. 

## Description

This project defines four states of the students: 

- Healthy

- Infected Contagious

And the timeline for each day is defined as :

1. ClassroomA

2. Cafeteria
3. DormA
4. ClassroomB
5. Gym
6. DormB

During running , you can control many parameters like:

- Time Scale
- Spread Rate
- Incubation Spread Rate
- Activity Rate

You can also Modify the sensitivity of mouse movement, the time spent of each process, etc.
